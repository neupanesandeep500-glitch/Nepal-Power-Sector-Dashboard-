visitor_counter.py — Google-Sheets-backed visitor counter
=============================================================
Problem this solves: a plain in-memory counter (or a JSON file on
ephemeral disk) resets to 0 every time the app redeploys, because most
hosts spin up a brand-new container/filesystem on each deploy. This
module fixes that by treating a small Google Sheet as the durable
store — the ONLY things ever written to it are:

    B1: current visitor count
    B2: last-update timestamp (when the app itself was last deployed/
        restarted — useful to see "the count survived this deploy")

Nothing else in your Google Sheet is touched. Reads/writes are scoped
to exactly these two cells.

DESIGN
------
- On boot: one read from the sheet seeds the in-memory counter. If the
  sheet is unreachable, we fall back to 0 and keep serving — a visitor
  counter glitch should never take the whole app down.
- On every visit: increment the FAST in-memory counter only. No
  network call per visit — that would hit Google Sheets API quotas
  under any real traffic and add latency to every page load.
- A background timer flushes the in-memory counter to the sheet every
  FLUSH_INTERVAL_SECONDS (default 60s), and also flushes immediately
  on flush_now()/shutdown, so you never lose more than ~1 minute of
  visits even in a hard crash.
- record_deploy() writes a "last update" timestamp to B2 — call this
  once at startup so you (or the sheet) can see when the app last
  redeployed, without that write happening on every visit either.

HOW TO WIRE THIS INTO app.py
-----------------------------
    import visitor_counter

    visitor_counter.bootstrap()             # call once at startup
    visitor_counter.start_background_flush()  # call once at startup

    @server.before_request
    def _count_visitor():
        # only count real page views, not static assets/API polling
        if request.path.startswith(("/static", "/api/")):
            return
        visitor_counter.increment()

    # anywhere you render a template / build a response:
    current_count = visitor_counter.get_count()

    # optional: call this once at the very end of your startup sequence
    # (after NEA.bootstrap() etc.) to stamp "last update" in the sheet
    visitor_counter.record_deploy()
