gis_bundled.py

Real Nepal province / district / local-body / national-boundary / protected-
area / claimed-area geometry, derived from the official Survey Department
"hermes_NPL_new_wgs" shapefile (4 layers: national boundary, 7 provinces,
77 districts, 776 local bodies — one of which, in Darchula district, has no
local-government TYPE assigned: that is the Limpiyadhura-Kalapani-Lipulekh
tract on Nepal's 2020 official map, split out into its own layer below) plus
the separate Protected_Area.geojson (national parks / reserves / buffer
zones), simplified and shipped as repo assets under data/gis/*.geojson so the
map works immediately on first deploy with zero configuration.

CHANGED vs the previous version of this file:
  - NEPAL_PROTECTED_AREAS_GEOJSON now loads from data/gis/nepal_protected_areas.geojson
    (real 35-feature layer) instead of the 19-feature hardcoded rectangle
    placeholder. The old hardcoded dict is kept below, renamed with a
    _PLACEHOLDER suffix, as the last-resort fallback only.
  - Added NEPAL_CLAIMED_AREA_GEOJSON (new) for the disputed tract.
